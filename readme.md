## by (Maram Alobaid)
#### I completed this project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## Dataset
>
The data consist of approximately 819163 bike rides from 2018( Jan-Jun). The attributes include the trip start/end time, start/end station, duration in seconds as well as additional information such as user type. The dataset was quite clear i just fixed som of the quality issues in it. The data can be found here, with feature documentation available her https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQmkX4iOT6Rcrin42vslquX2_wQCjIa_hbwD0xmxrERPSOJYDtpNc_3wwK_p9_KpOsfA6QVyEHdxxq7/pub?embedded=True

## Summary of Findings

> 
In the exploration, I found that there are two types of users using the system: subscribers who are mainly daily commuters, having short trips, and who rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9 am and 5-6 pm. On the other hand, the customers, which I believe he/she a tourists or occasional riders who use the system more on weekends to explore the Bay Area. However, the bike-share system being used more during spring and summertime.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> 
For my presentation, I will focus on the behavior of using the FordGoBike Sharing System by each uesr  in 2018 from (Jan-Jun). I will first show the univariate results for the 6 months . Afterwards, I will move to daily habits of customers and subscribers. I will then continue by showing the trip duration in (Min) by boxplot to know wich user take longer time for the trip. To finish, I introduce the heatmap to show when bikes are highly in demand throughout the month and when it is the peak hour for each user.
